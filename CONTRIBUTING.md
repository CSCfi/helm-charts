New charts can be added by using Pull requests. Charts must be added on a subdirectory of their own under the charts directory. So the full process is:

- Create a new branch from `main`.
- Add the code of the new chart (or modify an existing one). The code must be in a separate directory. The directory must be created in the `charts` directory.
- Commit, push and create a PR.
- ???
- Github actions will publish the chart automatically.

The repository is hosted in <https://cscfi.github.io/helm-charts>.
