# Helm charts repository for Rahti

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Starting on 28 August 2025, Bitnami will be changing its policy regarding its catalog. Read more [here](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/issues/83267)  
> - Current images will be moved to the [Bitnami Legacy Repository](https://hub.docker.com/u/bitnamilegacy) and will no longer be updated.  
> - Some images will still be available in the [Bitnami Secure Images](https://hub.docker.com/u/bitnamisecure) but only with the `latest` tag.  
> - To continue receiving images with the latest updates and access to different tags, you need to subscribe to the full version of Bitnami Secure Images: https://www.arrow.com/globalecs/uk/products/bitnami-secure-images/  
> - Some of our Helm Charts used `Bitnami` images. Our Helm Charts are now intended for testing/development purposes because they use `bitnamilegacy` and/or `bitnamisecure` docker repositories.  
> - However, the Bitnami project continues to make its source code available at [bitnami/containers](https://github.com/bitnami/containers) under the Apache 2 license. You can build the image and then push it to your CSC project. You can find more information on how to push images [here](https://docs.csc.fi/cloud/rahti/images/Using_Rahti_integrated_registry/)
